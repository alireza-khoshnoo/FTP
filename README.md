## C# stream file using multi threaded socket with TCP/IP to send and receive files between client & server
#### to run the code: find  the ' *.exe ' file under ' ConsoleApp1 -> bin -> Debug ' and ' WindowsFormsApp1 -> bin -> Debug ' and run them

✅ probably fixed (at line 37) but needs to be reBuilded.
